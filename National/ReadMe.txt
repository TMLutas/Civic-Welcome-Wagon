This repository is a collection of text documents that are for the purpose of creating a civic version of the venerable Welcome Wagon. 

When people enter into a new community, they're always walking into the middle of a conversation. Sometimes, that conversation was even about them, and there you go walking into the middle of that with no idea who is saying things or why. 

Awkward. 

The idea of a civic welcome wagon is for people to cut down on the awkward, to aid in orienting yourself in that new community you've decided to join so you'll fit in. Because once you fit in, you can start to stand out with your unique talents. 

There is a company out there actually called Welcome Wagon. While they certainly can download and use these files in their materials, they are not the force behind this project and the use of the term in describing this project is an admiring homage to an American institution. Their stuff can be found here:
